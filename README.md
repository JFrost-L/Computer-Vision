# Computer Vision Project: Feature Extraction for Image Classification and Retrieval

This repository focuses on applying **Computer Vision** techniques to perform **Image Classification** and **Image Retrieval** tasks. The project uses both **Early Vision** techniques and **Pretrained Deep Learning Models** to extract meaningful features from images. These features are then utilized for classification or retrieval purposes.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore two different approaches to feature extraction in computer vision:
1. **Early Vision Techniques**: Using traditional methods such as edge detection, color histograms, and texture features to extract image features.
2. **Pretrained Models**: Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., VGG, ResNet) pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet to extract high-level features from images.

By comparing the performance of these approaches, we aim to:
- Build an accurate model for **Image Classification**.
- Develop an efficient system for **Image Retrieval**.

## Key Components of This Repository

1. **Early Vision Feature Extraction**:
   - **Edge Detection**: Using Sobel, Canny, or other filters to extract edge-based features from images.
   - **Color Histograms**: Representing images by their color distribution in different color spaces (RGB, HSV, etc.).
   - **Texture Features**: Using techniques like Local Binary Patterns (LBP) or Gabor filters to capture texture information.

2. **Pretrained Model Feature Extraction**:
   - Using pretrained models like **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, and **Inception** to extract deep features from images. These models are trained on large-scale datasets and can capture complex patterns and structures in images.
   - **Fine-tuning** the pretrained models on a custom dataset to improve classification accuracy for domain-specific tasks.

3. **Image Classification**:
   - Using the extracted features to train classifiers such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, or **Deep Neural Networks** for image classification tasks.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

4. **Image Retrieval**:
   - Building an image retrieval system that finds similar images from a database based on extracted features.
   - **Distance Metrics** such as **Euclidean Distance** or **Cosine Similarity** are used to measure the similarity between images.
   - A user query image is compared to the dataset, and the most similar images are retrieved.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [Your Dataset Name] (e.g., CIFAR-10, Caltech101, or a custom image dataset). It contains the following key attributes:
- **Classes**: [List of image categories or classes].
- **Number of Images**: [Total number of images].
- **Image Dimensions**: Images are resized to a standard dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels for pretrained models).

You can download the dataset from [Dataset Source Link].

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resizing images to a consistent size.
   - Normalizing pixel values for pretrained model compatibility.
   - Augmenting the data with techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Early Vision**: Extracting color histograms, edge maps, and texture descriptors.
   - **Pretrained Models**: Extracting deep features from intermediate layers of models such as VGG16 and ResNet50.

3. **Image Classification**:
   - Training classifiers like SVM, k-NN, or fully connected neural networks using the extracted features.
   - Fine-tuning pretrained models for higher accuracy on classification tasks.

4. **Image Retrieval**:
   - Implementing a feature-based image retrieval system.
   - Using similarity measures to retrieve the most relevant images from the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For traditional computer vision tasks such as edge detection and color histogram extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training traditional classifiers like SVM and k-NN.
- **Keras & TensorFlow**: For using and fine-tuning pretrained deep learning models (VGG, ResNet, etc.).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **Faiss**: For efficient similarity search in image retrieval tasks.
